# Electrical-Consumption-Analysis
Power is one of the most critical components of infrastructure crucial for the economic growth and welfare of nations. The existence and development of adequate infrastructure is essential for sustained growth of the Indian economy. India is the world's third largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity. Sustained economic growth continues to drive electricity demand in India.

Consumption of electricity is known to follow economic activity closely. The industries that produce essential goods are operating at very low utilization levels. Hence, in such a scenario one expects electricity demands to go down.

Here is a notebook to give you a brief intro of the dataset that I created, through interactive visualizations which will allow you to browse through data visually. The intension is to build an intuition about the data thereby being able to answer questions of relevance. The date ranges from 28/10/2019 to 23/05/2020.

In this notebook I have put my hands on interactive plots which will enable anyone to browse the data with a few clicks. I hope you like it and get your hands on the dataset to build a notebook of your own.

Run the .ipynb file to get the results.
